Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="22">

I was a Chemical Engineering student at Vanderbilt University, and made the jump into CS.

Experience: 4+ years of programming experience building web applications.
Tech Stack: TypeScript/JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Angular, RxJS, GraphQL, REST, PostgreSQL, Golang, gRPC.
Website: [Portfolio](https://izzulaizad-portfolio.vercel.app/), forked from this awesome [repo](https://cveinnt.com)

I'm currently open to learning other techologies/frameworks for web development e.g. Next.js, Vercel, etc. but also 
open to exploring other fields of CS e.g. Data Analyst, Game Development.
